# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Generation-in-Finance

The goal of this project was to explore the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in analyzing financial news to support stock market trading decisions. Since public sentiment and investor behavior often shift based on news headlines and media tone, this project focused on using NLP models to classify sentiment and interpret the market impact of financial news.

Three sentiment analysis strategies were compared: using a clean pre-trained FinBERT model (notebook NoFineTune.ipynb), applying pseudo fine-tuning with labels generated by Financial-RoBERTa (notebook Pseudo-Fine-Tuned-Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb), and performing full fine-tuning of FinBERT on labeled data (Real-Fine-Tune-Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb). News headlines were collected in real-time using the NewsAPI, and the models were evaluated both at the dataset level and per news item. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess performance. 

In addition to sentiment classification, the project also implemented text generation using the WiroAI-Finance-Qwen-1.5B model. This model generated commentary or advice based on the computed sentiment category for each stock. For example, when the sentiment was neutral, the model produced insights advising caution rather than taking action.

This project demonstrates the practical application of NLP in financial decision support systems. By combining sentiment analysis with generative AI, it provides a foundation for more advanced tools that can interpret unstructured news data and assist investors in real-time.
